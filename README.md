Face Analysis and Privacy Detection – Phase 2

Using Flask, OpenCV, and Pre-Trained ML Models

Overview

This project analyzes human faces in uploaded images using pre-trained machine learning models.
It detects faces, predicts emotions, identifies gender, and can apply a privacy blur to anonymize results.

This is Phase 2 of the project and focuses on:

Extending the system with a user-friendly web UI.
Integrating the existing ML models into the UI.
Adding visualizations and validation metrics for model performance.
Technologies Used

Python 3
Flask – Backend web framework
OpenCV – Image processing
Pre-trained Models: Haar Cascade, DLIB, MTCNN, ResNet
HTML / CSS / JavaScript – Frontend UI
Matplotlib / Plotly (optional) – Visualizations
Project Structure

Will be updated soon based on next phases
